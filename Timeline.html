            <ul class="timelinelist"> <li>Inconsistent and Low Paying Work</li>
              <li>Working long hours, sometimes having seven day work weeks </li>
              <li>Actors were informed if they had to work again the following day five minutes before they left the studio </li>
              <li>Actors had to pay for their own wardrobe </li> 
              <li>No minimum rest period between being called in to work </li>
             <li>Actors would not get paid until they arrived on location, and did not take into account their transportation costs whether through public transit or car </li>
            </ul>
