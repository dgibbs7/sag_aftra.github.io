        <h3> Causes for Unionization</h3>
 <h4> Due to issues such as: inconsistent and low paying work, working long hours with no minimum rest period, and lack of reimbursement for travel time, cost, or wardrobe expenses, actors found it important to create a voice for themselves and unionize.</h4>
        <h3> The Union Today</h3>
        <h4> Today, the union prioritizes these same issues, however, faces problems due to a lack of diversity and representation for all performers. Our site strives to provide a wide variety of perspectives and experiences and ensure that more people are given the opportunity to share their voice and experience.</h4>
